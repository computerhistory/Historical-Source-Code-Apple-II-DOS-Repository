This is the source code for, and historical documents about, the Apple II DOS. It was originally released by the [Computer History Museum](https://computerhistory.org/) on November 12, 2013.

The Apple II computer was first released in 1977. The following year, Apple introduced a floppy disk drive for the Apple II. Steve Wozniak designed the floppy disk controller, and with Randy Wigginton wrote low-level read/write routines. Contract programmer Paul Laughton produced higher level elements of for the disk operating system: a file manager, BASIC interface, and utilities. The Apple II DOS version 3.1 was released in June 1978.

With thanks to Paul Laughton, in collaboration with Dr. Bruce Damer, founder and curator of the [DigiBarn Computer Museum](http://www.digibarn.com/), and with the permission of Apple Inc., we are pleased to make available the 1978 source code of Apple II DOS for non-commercial use. 

There are seven files in this release:

Technical Documents 102723983-05-01-acc.pdf: Various technical specifications and designs relating to the Apple II disk drive
Contracts 102723982-05-01-acc.pdf: Various contracts and addenda between Apple and Shepardson Microsystems
Apple_DOS_meeting_5Oct1978.pdf: Minutes of a meeting between Apple and Shepardson Microsystem about bugs and enhancements. 
Scott LaBombard, a dedicated vintage computer collector/restorer in New York, has done an amazing job researching and reconstructing Apple II DOS source code. He has given us permission to release the results of his work.

It is found in the repository in the LaBombard_8Dec13 folder. 

The “shepdos” directory in that archive represents his work on the scanned listings we got from Paul Laughton, and the “appledos31″ directory contains reconstructed source code that matches the production DOS 3.1 binaries released by Apple.
